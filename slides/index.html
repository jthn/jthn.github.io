            <h2>The Business Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Customers of an Account Based Marketing (ABM) solution were unable
              to demonstrate the effectiveness of their campaigns internally
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
              Even though the stakeholder may be an advocate for our product,
              they often struggled to rationalize the cost of our solution to
              decision makers in their company
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What Happened</h3>
            <p class="fragment">
              High churn rates for happy and engaged customers
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
              Effective use of the product required additional effort to analyze
              their campaigns
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
              No one really knew how their campaigns were performing
            </p>

            <h3>View Through Conversions</h3>
            <p>
              A metric which shows how many users saw your ad, but did not click

            <p class="fragment">
              <code>Account/CookieCluster</code> mapping was done when ingesting

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Our ethos was to treat every impression and page view as a data point in a potential
            conversion</p>

            <p class="fragment">We already had to process all of the data in a <code>ConversionSegment</code>
            to support the baseline product</p>

            <p class="fragment">Adding additional data sinks to this process had a negligible effect on our
            cost per event processed</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>By exposing the "data neighborhood" to the rest of the system, we were able to create a more
            flexible framework on top of which new products and services could be realized</p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Planning phase was very important here as we created a more concise language for thinking about
            the lifecycle of an ad</p>

            <p class="fragment">Biggest gotcha was creating a constant time pattern matcher for user-defined conversions (with
            wildcards)</p>

            <p class="fragment">Product loved it, as it gave them a centralized, fact-based data model that
            they could create new functionality on top of</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>We were able to release to our internal marketers on schedule, but release to
            our beta group was a few weeks later than expected, but within the timeframe allowed</p>

            <p class="fragment">The entire planning &amp; development lifecycle was right around 3 months
            (including the "go or no go" decisions)</p>
